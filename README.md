# Cypress, from Zero to the Cloud

Sample project for the "Cypress, from to the Cloud" course of the Talking About Testing online school.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have git, Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `2.47.1` and `v22.12.0` and `10.9.0` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

> **Note:** Before running the tests, make a copy of the `cypress.env.example.json` file as `cypress.env.json`, which in the real world, you would update with valid credentials.

### Desktop

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.
Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.

Run `npm test:mobile` to run the test in headless mode.
Or, run `npm run cy:open:mobile` to open Cypress in interactive mode.
